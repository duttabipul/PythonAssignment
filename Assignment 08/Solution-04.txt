# Problem -04. You are given an array items, where each items[i] = [typei, colori, namei] describes the type, color, and
# name of the ith item. You are also given a rule represented by two strings, ruleKey and ruleValue.

def solve(items, ruleKey, ruleValue):
   count = 0
   if ruleKey == "type":
      for i in range(len(items)):
         if items[i][0] == ruleValue:
            count += 1
   if ruleKey == "color":
      for i in range(len(items)):
         if items[i][1] == ruleValue:
            count += 1
   if ruleKey == "name":
      for i in range(len(items)):
         if items[i][2] == ruleValue:
            count += 1
   return count
items = [["phone","blue","pixel"],["computer","silver","lenovo"],["phone","gold","iphone"]]
ruleKey = "type"
ruleValue = "phone"
print("The items list: ", items)
print("Matching items: ", solve(items, ruleKey, ruleValue))

# output:
# The items list:  [['phone', 'blue', 'pixel'], ['computer', 'silver', 'lenovo'], ['phone', 'gold', 'iphone']]
# Matching items:  2
