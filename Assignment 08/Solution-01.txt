# Problem - 01
# Given a non-negative integer x, compute and return the square root of x.
# Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated, and only the integer part of the
# result is returned.

number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
square_root = number ** 0.5
print("The square root of", number, "is :", square_root)
print("The integer part of the result is: ", int(square_root))

# output: Enter a number: 10
# The square root of 10 is : 3.1622776601683795
# The integer part of the result is:  3

# Note:
# we know that if a number have power ½ or 0.5
# then it will represent to the square root of that number.
# That’s why we are using 0.5 as power here.
