# 02. Write a Python program to read the value of an integer “num” and display the value
# of 100 when num is larger than 0, 0 when num is 0, and -1 when num is less than 0.


num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

if num > 0:
    print("The number is larger than zero")
elif num == 0:
        print("The zero is equal to zero")
else:
    print("The number is less than zero")


# 3 output:
# 1. Enter a number: 100
# The number is larger than zero

# 2. Enter a number: 0
# The zero is equal to zero

# 3. Enter a number: -3
# The number is less than zero
