# 04. Write a Python program to read the temperature in centigrade and display a suitable
# message according to the temperature state below:
# Temp < 0 then Freezing weather
# Temp 0-10 then Very Cold weather
# Temp 10-20 then Cold weather
# Temp 20-30 then Normal in Temp
# Temp 30-40 then It’s Hot
# Temp >=40 then It’s Very Hot

print("Put down a value: ")
temp = int(input())
print("Temperature shown in Centigrade: ")
if temp < 0:
    print("Freezing weather")
elif temp >= 0 and temp <=10:
    print("The weather is very cold")
elif temp >= 11 and temp <=20:
    print("Cold weather")
elif temp >= 21 and temp <=30:
    print("Normal temperature")
elif temp >= 31 and temp <=40:
    print("It's a hot day")
elif temp >= 40:
    print("Very hot temperature")

# output:
# Put down a value:
# 5
# Temperature shown in Centigrade:
# The weather is very cold
